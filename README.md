📊 Superstore Sales Analysis
🏪 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from Superstore Sales, one of Canada's largest retail chains. The primary objective is to identify product subcategories that are highly profitable and those that are causing losses. These insights will help in making strategic business decisions, such as discontinuing unprofitable products or optimizing sales strategies.

📂 Dataset
The dataset, superstore_sales.csv, contains sales records across various regions and customer segments. The analysis specifically targets the Corporate customer segment to extract meaningful insights.

📌 Key Tasks and Methodology
✅ Data Preparation & Formatting
Increased column widths for better readability

Applied header formatting with colors and borders

Filtered data to extract only the Corporate customer segment

Organized the dataset into separate worksheets based on customer segments

📊 Report Generation
Data Cleaning: Removed unnecessary columns and formatted dates (e.g., 15-Jan-2012)

Sales & Profit Adjustments: Rounded off figures to one decimal place and formatted values in USD

Sorting: Ordered data by Region, then Province, and finally sorted by sales in descending order

Conditional Formatting:

Highlighted the top 10% sales within each Province

Applied a color scale (green for profit, red for loss) to visually analyze profitability

🔍 Insights with Pivot Tables
High-Profit Categories

Identified the top 3 most profitable product subcategories in each region

Compared profit margins across regions using Pivot Tables

Applied conditional formatting to highlight key trends and anomalies

Loss-Making Categories

Found the least profitable product subcategories

Identified regions where these subcategories performed poorly

Observed patterns in related product sales (e.g., correlation between tables and chairs)

🖨 Final Report & Exporting
Applied double bottom borders to separate each Region for better presentation

Optimized page layouts for printing and PDF export

Implemented password protection for sensitive data

🏆 Key Takeaways
Certain product subcategories consistently perform well across multiple regions, making them strong revenue drivers.

Some loss-making subcategories show region-specific trends, indicating that discontinuation might not be necessary everywhere.

The correlation between furniture items (tables & chairs) suggests potential bundling strategies to maximize sales.

📌 Technologies Used
